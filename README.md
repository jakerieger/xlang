# xlang

**xlang** is a bytecode interpreted scripting language written in C.
Its primary purpose is to serve as a learning project for myself
and a fun side project to work on in my free time. It is not designed
with the intent of being a serious, production-ready language.

## Examples

Example code can be found in the [src_test](src_test) directory.

```
x = 10
y = 0.44
z = x * y
z2 = x ** y
z3 = x % y
z4 = x / y
z5 = x // y

# allow multiple args for print
print(z, z2, z3, z4, z5)
```
